# RadixSort-Infix-Postfix-Form
Mathematical expression evaluator that performs calculations while maintaining the correct order of operation evaluation. The expressions are transformed in the postfix form so that the operators can be placed after the operands, with the added benefit of eliminating the need for parentheses. Radix sort is an integer sorting algorithm that orders a collection of numbers based on the values of the digits in the position corresponding to the current iteration.
